{{< title >}} is a smart and versatile geo-data registration app, made in the Netherlands

The app offers organisations a tool for managing their geo-data using **open OGC standards**. Features include editing
GIS features (point, lines, polygons), smart forms for non-spatial information, fuzzy search and photo attachments. The
data is stored directly in your own GIS environment - such as [GeoServer](https://geoserver.org/) - via
the [WFS-T](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wfs/reference.html) standard.

{{< title >}} was launched in 2018 and focuses mainly on the Dutch and Belgian market. Currently, the tool is used by
municipalities, engineering firms, contractors and safety regions. Don't hesitate to contact us with questions at {{<
